## Work Experience
Data Analyst Intern @ Grasim Industries (August 2024 - December 2024)
-Analyzed the performance of a Multi-Stage Flash Evaporator, identifying key efficiency metrics and operational bottlenecks
-Developed predictive models to optimize the control system for enhanced process stability and efficiency
-Designed and implemented a performance monitoring system to track daily operational metrics


## Projects
### Urban Sound Classification
Developed a deep learning model to classify urban sounds using the UrbanSound8K dataset
Implemented feature extraction techniques such as MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) for improved accuracy
Trained and evaluated the model using CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for robust sound classification

### Image De-hazer
Implemented a Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to remove haze from images
Trained the model using a dataset of hazy and corresponding clear images for image-to-image translation
Improved visual clarity by leveraging conditional GANs to generate high-quality dehazed outputs
